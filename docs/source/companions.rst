Companion Agents
================

While the functionality of `nmf.models` is all that is necessary to perform
constrained matrix factorization, it is worth developing some task specific agents
that create reports or characterize data based on the CMF results.

This is an active area of development.
For more insights in how to deploy cmf, check out this repository for
`experiments at 28-ID PDF <https://github.com/NSLS-II-PDF/federation-of-agents>`_.
